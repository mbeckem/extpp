Open Questions / Design Issues
==============================

-   Containers should cache some of their state in memory, so that it can inspected using a debugger.
    Currently they all use a handle<T> for their anchor state, which is of course the right thing.
    However, a handle only refers to the serialized value in a block (i.e. some byte blob) and does not
    keep the deserialized object in memory. Doing so would introduce synchronization issues (e.g. handles
    A and B refer to the same byte address but have different cached values, so they don't see each others
    updates immediately).
    I think the best way to solve this is to simply duplicate some fields (size, root node index etc).

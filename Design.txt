1) In which places should the BlockSize be a template parameter/compile time constant?

Currently, the block size is required to be a constant in the generation of block-sized
structures, e.g. B-Tree nodes. Therefore it has to be a template parameter for all
external datastructures. We *could* also make it a compile time constant in
classes like `address`, `allocator` or `block_engine`.

Open Tasks
==========

- Async prefetch for block reads. Engine should have function for reading that returns a future.
  Real I/O should be done in a worker thread.
- Better programming model for anchor creation/destruction, for example static create(...) destroy(...) fn.
- Implement transactional engine with write ahead log

- Implement Hashtable, Queue and Priority Queue

- Replace c-style callbacks with std::function ones.
- Rethink some API design decisions that dont make much sense in modern C++,
  for example functions returning bool and taking an output reference.

Open Tasks
==========

- Async prefetch for block reads. Engine should have function for reading that returns a future.
  Real I/O should be done in a worker thread.
- Better programming model for anchor creation/destruction, for example static create(...) destroy(...) fn.

- Implement Queue and Priority Queue

- Replace c-style callbacks with std::function ones.
- Rethink some API design decisions that dont make much sense in modern C++,
  for example functions returning bool and taking an output reference.

- Review examples

- Integrity checking support. Currently, every datastructure has complete control over the contents
  of its own data blocks. This prevents applications from inserting custom metadata into those blocks,
  for example to check for unexpected corruption (magic numbers, checksums, owners, etc.)
